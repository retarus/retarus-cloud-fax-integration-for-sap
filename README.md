# Get Started with Retarus Cloud Fax Integration for SAP BTP

## Introduction

The aim of this Integration package is to give SAP BTP developers an out-of-the-box tool to get connected with *Retarus Cloud Fax REST API* with no need to develop the required code by themselves.

## Business Case

The pre-configured connector can be seamlessly integrated into business flows via SAP BTP and SAP Integration Suite and addresses organizations who want to modernize and automate their faxing while moving to SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

The Integration flows supplied here can be a part of wider integration scenarios or can be directly called by a web application with a basic capability of sending files over https by using a simple form-data.

## Prerequisites

1. Integration Suite enabled for your Subaccount in SAP BTP
2. Open Connectors enabled for your Integration Suite
